### add bikeshare
First, you'll fork a repository to get your own copy of a template for this project, and then clone it to
your local computer. Your first task will then be to add your bikeshare.py file, data file, and a .gitignore 
file to exclude your data file from version control tracking. This is a common practice to avoid sharing your 
data publicly, to avoid tracking unnecessarily huge files on GitHub, and because changes in data don't often affect our code.

## Project Overview

This project analyzes bikeshare data from three major cities: Washington, New York City, and Chicago. The analysis includes various statistics about bike usage, popular times for biking, and user demographics.

### New Updates:
- Improved documentation for better understanding.
- Added line comments and docstrings in bikeshare analysis script.

## Recent Updates
- Refactored the function for calculating averages to improve readability and add error handling.
- Optimized loops using list comprehensions for better performance.

## add trip_duration_stats function
Displays total travel time in hours and the average trip duration in minutes.
The travel times are calculated by summing and averaging the 'Trip Duration' column, which is assumed to be in seconds.
