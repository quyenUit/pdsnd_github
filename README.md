### add bikeshare
First, you'll fork a repository to get your own copy of a template for this project, and then clone it to
your local computer. Your first task will then be to add your bikeshare.py file, data file, and a .gitignore 
file to exclude your data file from version control tracking. This is a common practice to avoid sharing your 
data publicly, to avoid tracking unnecessarily huge files on GitHub, and because changes in data don't often affect our code.

## Project Overview

This project analyzes bikeshare data from three major cities: Washington, New York City, and Chicago. The analysis includes various statistics about bike usage, popular times for biking, and user demographics.

### New Updates:
- Improved documentation for better understanding.
- Added line comments and docstrings in bikeshare analysis script.

## Recent Updates
- Refactored the function for calculating averages to improve readability and add error handling.
- Optimized loops using list comprehensions for better performance.

## add user_stats function 
Displays counts of different user types, such as Subscribers or Customers.
For cities other than Washington, it shows the gender distribution and birth year statistics:
The earliest, most recent, and most common birth years are calculated.
Washington data does not contain gender or birth year information, so itâ€™s skipped for this city.

## add display_raw_data function
This function allows users to view the raw data 10 rows at a time by repeatedly asking if they want to see more data.
