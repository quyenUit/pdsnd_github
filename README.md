### add bikeshare
First, you'll fork a repository to get your own copy of a template for this project, and then clone it to
your local computer. Your first task will then be to add your bikeshare.py file, data file, and a .gitignore 
file to exclude your data file from version control tracking. This is a common practice to avoid sharing your 
data publicly, to avoid tracking unnecessarily huge files on GitHub, and because changes in data don't often affect our code.
